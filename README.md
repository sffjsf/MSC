# Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection Based on Multi-source Pseudo-labels and Spatial Context
We acknowledge the work of [A2S-v2](https://github.com/moothes/A2S-v2) and [A2S](https://github.com/moothes/A2S-USOD). Most of the code implementations in this study are consistent with or similar to their methods.
